The first thing any document using more-routing must do is configure the driver.

more-routing supports path (`/foo/bar`) and hash (`#!/foo/bar`) style routes.

<more-routing-config driver="hash"></more-routing-config>
<!--
You can name routes.

It is strongly recommended that you declare all your named routes in an import
such as this, as it acts as a reference for your application, and makes nesting
more clear.
